XJPlayer coding style
=====================

I) Code layout
--------------

The code has to follow Java code convention (http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html)
with some additions:
- Each opening braces (method, class, ...) MUST be on their own line;
- Use 4 spaces instead of tabs;
- Use package imports (import mypackage.*;) instead of importing single class.

II) Code organization
---------------------

The code has to follow these recommendations:
- Always initialize your variables;
- Use "final" keyword for pointers and references if they should not been modified in function/method;
- Put a space before and after operator +/-* i.e. a + b - ((c * 5) / 3);
- Put an empty line at the end of each file.

Naming has to follow these recommendations:
- All class member variables name must be prefixed with "m" (mVar).

Each class, member, methods including private and protected ones MUST be documented.
